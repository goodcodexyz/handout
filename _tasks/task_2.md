    steps:
      [
        "If you got it correctly, your sprite should change it's costume.",
        "Now, add another <bl>switch costume to [1080 pop R arm v]</bl> and attach it to the block you placed earlier.",

    steps:
      [
        "The costume might have changed, but it should have changed twice.",
        "That is because the costume switched twice really fast!",
        "To fix this, add <bl>wait (1) secs</bl> in the middle of the two blocks.",
        "Click the blocks again and see what happens.",
        "It should change costume twice."
