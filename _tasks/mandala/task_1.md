  steps:
  - Hey there! I hope you had fun learning sequences!
  - Today we'll learn more about loops through making mandalas.
  - Before we start, we gotta make our brush.

  steps:
  - We won't be using Scratch cat for now, but don't delete him.
  - Let's use the shrink tool on the cat to make it really small.
  - For this activity, the cat will be our brush!

  steps:
  - Now, let's try drawing with Scratch!
  - First, let's use <bl>when [space v] key pressed</bl>
  - Now, attach <bl>pen down</bl>. This will make your sprite draw where ever it moves.
  - Try it by attaching <bl>move (100) steps</bl>.
  - Press spacebar and see what happens.

  steps:
  - Let's clear the drawing whenever we press the green flag by using this <bl>When green flag clicked</bl>.
  - Attach <bl>pen up</bl> and then <bl>clear</bl>.
  - To reset the cat's position to the middle, attach <bl>go to x:(0) y:(0)</bl>.
  - We'll be rotating the cat later on, so we should also reset its rotation by using <bl>point in direction(90 v)</bl>.
  - To make sure the cat is small enough, attach <bl>set size to (30)%</bl> from the Looks blocks.
  - Your code block should look like this.
