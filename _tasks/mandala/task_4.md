  steps:
  - It may look complicated but it's actually pretty simple!

  steps:
  - Oops! We have to change the angle of rotation after the cat draws a circle as
    well!
  - Can you solve how many degrees should the cat rotate 8 times to make a full rotation
    or 360 degrees?
  - Clue! Divide 360 with the number of times the cat will draw the circle!
