  steps:
  - Let's make your first brush!
  - If you press A key, it should draw a square with <bl>pick random (10) to (100)</bl> for its size.
  - Every time you draw a square, the color and pen size should change.
  - Make it draw at a random position!
  - Don't forget to run it in Turbo Mode (hold shift while clicking the Green Flag)!

  steps:
  - Let's make one for circles when you press S key!
  - This time, set the size with <bl>pick random (0.01) to (1)</bl> only.
  - This makes the circles fit in the stage.
  - To make your brushes more interesting, feel free to add sounds every time you press a button.
