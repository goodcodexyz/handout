  steps:
  - To start a scene you usually use <bl>when green flag clicked</bl>.
  - Here we set whatever the starting scene will contain.
  - Once we add more elements to our story, it always helps to have a reset feature.
  - Using this block, add the elements you want to be seen at the start of your scene.

  - Unless you want to start with a blank backdrop, go select the first backdrop of your scene.

  - Here are some of the blocks we use to reset our scene.
  - <bl>go to x:(0) y:(0)</bl> places your sprite's initial position.
  - <bl>show</bl> and <bl>hide</bl> are used on sprites depending on when they will appear in your scene.
  - <bl>switch costume to [costume1 v]</bl> to choose your sprite's first look.
  - <bl>set size to (100) %</bl> is helpful if the size of your sprite changes over time.
