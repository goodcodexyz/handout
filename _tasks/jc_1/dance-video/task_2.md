  steps:
  - If you got it correctly, your sprite should change it's costume.
  - Now, add another <bl>switch costume to [1080 pop R arm v]</bl> and attach it to
    the block you placed earlier.
  - Make sure the costume is different from the one you chose earlier.
  - Click any of the blocks and see what happens.

  steps:
  - The costume might have changed, but it should have changed twice.
  - That is because the costume switched twice really fast!
  - To fix this, add <bl>wait (1) secs</bl> in the middle of the two blocks.
  - Click the blocks again and see what happens.
  - It should change costume twice.

    degrees
