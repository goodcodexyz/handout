  steps:
  - To make the cat draw a circle we make him move 1 step forward and turn 1 degree
    360 times!
  - Now that we know loops, drawing a circle shouldn't be so hard!
  - Attach <bl>repeat () </bl> and add 360.
  - Inside the repeat block, add <bl>move (1) steps</bl> and <bl>turn CW (1) degrees</bl>.
  - Now press spacebar and see what happens!

  steps:
  - The cat moves quite slow though. Let's make it rush!
  - Under Edit menu, click Turbo Mode.
  - You may also hold shift while clicking the green flag to turn on Turbo Mode.
  - Now press the green flag, then press spacebar and see what happens.
  - Now the cat is a fast as The Flash!
