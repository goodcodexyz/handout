  steps:
  - Let's add a bit more challenge!
  - Every time the cat touches the mouse, the dog moves to a random spot as well.

  steps:
  - This time, the cat won't be able to pass through the dog.
  - Use <bl>touching [Dog v] ?</bl> in an <bl>if < > then</bl> block.
  - If the cat touches the dog, make it move backwards by using <bl>move (-10) steps</bl>.

  steps:
  - Finally, to make the game even more fun, add more dogs!
  - When the cat touches the mouse, check if the score reaches 10.
  - You can use the operator <bl>< (score) = [10] ></bl> in an <bl>if < > then</bl> block.
  - Insert <bl>create clone of [Dog v]</bl> to add another dog.
